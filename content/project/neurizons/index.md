## About Neurizons
Neurizons is a multidisciplinary neuroscience conference organized by the students of the [International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neurosciences](https://www.gpneuro.uni-goettingen.de/), in Göttingen. I have been part of the organizing committee since 2017 and have mainly taken care of the conference's graphic design.

Neurizons 2020 took place online, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. I took part in migrating the conference into a virtual platform - [crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/). You can read about my main take-aways from this experience in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/niksirbi/status/1280875270510125056).
