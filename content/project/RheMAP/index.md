## Summary
The RheMAP project provides access to a set of pre-calculated non-linear registrations between some of the most commonly used rhesus macaque brain templates (D99, INIA19, MNI macaque, NMT, Yerkes19). The [repository](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/RheMAP) contains the code used to calculate the registration warps and example code that demonstrates how to use the resulting warp files to remap data between different template spaces. Non-linear registration warps were generated using [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and can directly be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3668510).
