I'm Niko, a medical doctor turned neuroscientist and image analyst. Since October 2022, I work as a Research Software Engineer at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/).

I completed my PhD at the [Functional Imaging Lab](https://www.dpz.eu/en/unit/functional-imaging-laboratory/about-us.html) of the [German Primate Center](https://www.dpz.eu), where I studied the effects of anesthesia on brain function using neuroimaging techniques, including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging.

I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time, you will find me dancing to swing music and trying to play the saxophone.
