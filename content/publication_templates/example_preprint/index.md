abstract: Medetomidine has become a popular choice for anesthetizing rats during long-lasting sessions of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Despite this, it has not yet been established how commonly reported fMRI readouts evolve over several hours of medetomidine anesthesia and how they are affected by the precise timing, dose, and route of administration. We used four different protocols of medetomidine administration to anesthetize rats for up to six hours and repeatedly evaluated somatosensory stimulus-evoked BOLD responses and resting state functional connectivity throughout. We found that the temporal evolution of fMRI readouts strongly depended on the method of administration. Protocols that combined an initial medetomidine bolus (0.05 mg/kg) together with a subsequent continuous infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h) led to temporally stable measures of stimulus-evoked activity and functional connectivity. However, when the bolus was omitted, or the dose of medetomidine lowered, the measures attenuated in a time-dependent manner. We conclude that medetomidine can sustain consistent fMRI readouts for up to six hours of anesthesia, but only with an appropriate administration protocol. This factor should be considered for the design and interpretation of future preclinical fMRI studies in rats.
