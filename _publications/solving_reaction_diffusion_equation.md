excerpt: 'The reaction-diffusion equation is one of the cornerstones equations in applied science and engineering. In the present study, a deep neural network has been trained in order to predict the solution of the equation with different coefficients using the numerical solution of this equation and the utility of deep learning. Analytical solution of the Reaction-Diffusion equation also has been conducted by taking advantage of the Danckwerts method. The accuracy of deep learning results was compared with the analytical solutions. In order to decrease the learning time and to find out similar equations solutions, such as pure diffusion and pure reaction, dimensional analysis technique has been performed. It was demonstrated that deep learning can accurately estimate the Partial Differential Equations solutionin the case of the reaction-diffusion equation with a constant coefficient.'
