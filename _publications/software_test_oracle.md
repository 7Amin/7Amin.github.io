excerpt: 'This work introduces a novel software test Oracle based on deep learning and a fuzzy inference system, aimed at automating the testing process while minimizing time and cost. The Oracle maps the software output to a fuzzy space using Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference and trains a deep neural network. The performance of the Oracle is evaluated using different models, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect correct and false results.'

One of the challenging issues in software designing is testing the product in different condition. Various software Oracles had suggested in the literature, and the aim of all of them is minimizing the time and cost of the testing process. Software test Oracles have designed to do this job automatically with as less as possible human contribution. In this work, a novel Oracle based on deep learning and fuzzy inference system introduced. For this purpose, by the utility of Takagi-SugenoKang fuzzy inference, the output of software mapped to the fuzzy space, and the deep neural network has trained by this data. Finally, data has remapped to the primary form and used as the competitor stage input. To validate the performance of the Oracle, four different models have chosen to assess the Oracle enforcement, and after training the Oracle by the correct output of applications, source codes have changed manually, and the efficiency of the Oracle monitored. Several measures have been applied to evaluate the accuracy of the test Oracle, and it is observed that in most cases Oracle correctly could detect the correct and false results. Finally, designing Oracles requires several preliminaries and in this work we only focus on the architecture of the system.
