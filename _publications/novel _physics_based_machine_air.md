Cost-effective sensors are capable of real-time capturing a variety of air quality-related modalities from different pollutant concentrations to indoor/outdoor humidity and temperature. Machine learning (ML) models are capable of performing air-quality "ahead of-time" approximations. Undoubtedly, accurate indoor air quality approximation significantly helps provide a healthy indoor environment, optimize associated energy consumption, and offer human comfort. However, it is crucial to design an ML architecture to capture the domain knowledge, so-called problem physics. In this study, we propose six novel physics-based ML models for accurate indoor pollutant concentration approximations. The proposed models include an adroit combination of state-space concepts in physics, Gated Recurrent Units, and Decomposition techniques. The proposed models were illustrated using data collected from five offices in a commercial building in California. The proposed models are shown to be less complex, computationally more efficient, and more accurate than similar state-of-the-art transformer-based models. The superiority of the proposed models is due to their relatively light architecture (computational efficiency) and, more importantly, their ability to capture the underlying highly nonlinear patterns embedded in the often contaminated sensor-collected indoor air quality temporal data.
