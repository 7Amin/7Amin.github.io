excerpt: 'Estimating the travel time of any route is of great importance for trip planners, traffic operators, online taxi dispatching and ride-sharing platforms, and navigation provider systems. With the advance of technology, many traveling cars, including online taxi dispatch systems vehicles are equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that can report the location of the vehicle every few seconds. This paper uses GPS data and the Matrix Factorization techniques to estimate the travel times on all road segments and time intervals simultaneously. We aggregate GPS data into a matrix, where each cell of the original matrix contains the average vehicle speed for a segment and a specific time interval. One of the problems with this matrix is its high sparsity. We use Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method along with a regularization term to factorize the matrix. Since this approach can solve the sparsity problem that arises from the absence of cars in many road segments in a specific time interval, matrix factorization is suitable for estimating the travel time. Our comprehensive evaluation results using real data provided by one of the largest online taxi dispatching systems in Iran, shows the strength of our proposed method.'

Estimating the travel time of any route is of great importance for trip planners, traffic operators, online taxi dispatching and ride-sharing platforms, and navigation provider systems. With the advance of technology, many traveling cars, including online taxi dispatch systems' vehicles are equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices that can report the location of the vehicle every few seconds. This paper uses GPS data and the Matrix Factorization techniques to estimate the travel times on all road segments and time intervals simultaneously. We aggregate GPS data into a matrix, where each cell of the original matrix contains the average vehicle speed for a segment and a specific time interval. One of the problems with this matrix is its high sparsity. We use Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method along with a regularization term to factorize the matrix. Since this approach can solve the sparsity problem that arises from the absence of cars in many road segments in a specific time interval, matrix factorization is suitable for estimating the travel time. Our comprehensive evaluation results using real data provided by one of the largest online taxi dispatching systems in Iran, shows the strength of our proposed method.
