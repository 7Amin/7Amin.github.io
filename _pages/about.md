<!-- I am currently on an exciting academic journey, pursuing a __Ph.D. in Computer Science__ at __Ohio State University__. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer engineering at the __Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran__. During my Bachelor's, I specialized in hardware, while my Master's focused on software. -->

I am a dedicated __Ph.D. student in Computer Science__ at __The Ohio State University__, focusing on __Computer Vision, Vision-Language Models, and Self-Supervised Learning__ under the supervision of [Professor Rajiv Ramnath](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6). My research encompasses image and video generation, as well as self-supervised learning techniques to advance the field of computer vision.

# Research Interests:

### Image and Video Generation:

* Developing innovative methods for generating high-quality images and videos.
* Projects include Multi-Guided Image Inpainting and Multi-Modal Conditional Video Generation.
* Exploring how the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized in video generation with diffusion models.

### Self-Supervised Learning for Vision:

* Designing self-supervised approaches to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data.
* Projects include Frequency-Guided Masking for Enhanced Vision Self-Supervised Learning and a self-supervised approach for general images using multimodal architectures like CLIP.
* Applying self-supervised learning to medical image analysis to overcome the challenge of limited labeled data.

### Medical Image Analysis:

* Utilizing self-supervised learning to train models on unlabeled medical images.
* It aims to extract valuable features for better analysis and interpretation in the medical domain.
* Developed Masked LoGoNet, a neural network architecture with tailored self-supervised learning for efficient medical image segmentation.


Ph.D.
---------

The first domain, __Smart Mobility__, revolves around the utilization of deep learning techniques for time series analysis. Specifically, I am developing models to predict and analyze the __risk of accidents__ and __road construction__ within specific zones. To achieve this, I leverage various data sources, including historical data, weather information, satellite and map images, as well as demographic information.

Second, in __medical image analysis__, I focused on addressing a common challenge: the limited availability of labeled data. To overcome this obstacle, I adopted a __self-supervised learning__ approach. By leveraging this technique, I aimed to train models using unlabeled medical images, allowing them to learn meaningful representations and extract valuable features from the data.

Another exciting domain of my research under the supervision of Professor Rajiv Ramnath involves __applying reinforcement learning to playing Atari games__. Our primary focus in this project is to tackle the __exploration problem__ in reinforcement learning. Exploration is a critical challenge in RL, as it involves discovering new strategies and actions to maximize rewards in a game environment.


Bachelor and Master
-------------

My Bachelor's thesis focused on __applying reinforcement learning in a multi-object environment__. In this unique setting, each object had the ability to train individually. Additionally, I incorporated federated learning techniques to enable the objects to generalize their models to each other. This research explored the potential of combining these approaches to enhance learning and decision-making in complex environments.

For my Master's thesis, I delved into the realm of __software testing__. Specifically, I proposed an innovative approach to __generating datasets__ using machine learning techniques. This approach aimed to cover the main paths within the software, enabling effective fault detection. By leveraging machine learning, I sought to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of software testing processes, ultimately improving software systems' overall quality and reliability.

As a dedicated academic researcher, I have been honored to receive recognition for my scholarly contributions by publishing nine papers in renowned conferences and esteemed journals.

With a rich and diverse background, I have accumulated eight years of experience and honed my skills as a seasoned data scientist, proficient back-end developer, and accomplished researcher. This extensive journey has allowed me to cultivate a wealth of expertise in these domains. However, my capabilities extend beyond academic pursuits. I have also showcased my proficiency in teaching and coaching by serving as a Teaching Assistant for various courses on 14 separate occasions during my time at Ohio State University and Shahid Beheshti University. This experience has enhanced my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and support the learning journey of students from diverse backgrounds.

I embrace the opportunity to refine problem-solving methodologies for arduous tasks and eagerly embrace the prospect of acquiring new technologies and tools.
