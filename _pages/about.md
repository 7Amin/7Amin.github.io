## Bachelor and Master


My Bachelor's thesis focused on __applying reinforcement learning in a multi-object environment__. In this unique setting, each object had the ability to train individually. Additionally, I incorporated federated learning techniques to enable the objects to generalize their models to each other. This research explored the potential of combining these approaches to enhance learning and decision-making in complex environments.

For my Master's thesis, I delved into the realm of __software testing__. Specifically, I proposed an innovative approach to __generating datasets__ using machine learning techniques. This approach aimed to cover the main paths within the software, enabling effective fault detection. By leveraging machine learning, I sought to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of software testing processes, ultimately improving software systems' overall quality and reliability.
