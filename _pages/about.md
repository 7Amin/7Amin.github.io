<!-- I am currently on an exciting academic journey, pursuing a __Ph.D. in Computer Science__ at __Ohio State University__. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer engineering at the __Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran__. During my Bachelor's, I specialized in hardware, while my Master's focused on software. -->

I am a dedicated __Ph.D. student in Computer Science__ at __The Ohio State University__, focusing on __Computer Vision, Vision-Language Models, and Self-Supervised Learning__ under the supervision of [Professor Rajiv Ramnath](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6). My research encompasses image and video generation, as well as self-supervised learning techniques to advance the field of computer vision.

## Bachelor and Master (Past)


My Bachelor's thesis focused on __applying reinforcement learning in a multi-object environment__. In this unique setting, each object had the ability to train individually. Additionally, I incorporated federated learning techniques to enable the objects to generalize their models to each other. This research explored the potential of combining these approaches to enhance learning and decision-making in complex environments.

For my Master's thesis, I delved into the realm of __software testing__. Specifically, I proposed an innovative approach to __generating datasets__ using machine learning techniques. This approach aimed to cover the main paths within the software, enabling effective fault detection. By leveraging machine learning, I sought to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of software testing processes, ultimately improving software systems' overall quality and reliability.
