<!-- I am currently on an exciting academic journey, pursuing a __Ph.D. in Computer Science__ at __Ohio State University__. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer engineering at the __Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran__. During my Bachelor's, I specialized in hardware, while my Master's focused on software. -->

I am a dedicated __Ph.D. student in Computer Science__ at __The Ohio State University__, focusing on __Computer Vision, Vision-Language Models, and Self-Supervised Learning__ under the supervision of [Professor Rajiv Ramnath](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ramnath.6). My research encompasses image and video generation, as well as self-supervised learning techniques to advance the field of computer vision.

<!-- __<span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for a research internship for summer  2025!</span>__ -->


# Research Interests:

### Image and Video Generation:

* Developing innovative methods for generating high-quality images and videos.
* Extending image-based generative strategies into multi-frame sequences, focusing on preserving consistent identity, style, and motion dynamics.
* Employing hierarchical knowledge structures to capture subtle morphological or stylistic variations, allowing for highly distinctive yet consistent image synthesis.
* Exploring how the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized in video generation with diffusion models.

### Self-Supervised Learning for Vision:

* Designing self-supervised approaches to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data.
* Projects include Frequency-Guided Masking for Enhanced Vision Self-Supervised Learning and a self-supervised approach for general images using multimodal architectures like CLIP.
* Applying self-supervised learning to medical image analysis to overcome the challenge of limited labeled data.

### Medical Image Analysis:

* Utilizing self-supervised learning to train models on unlabeled medical images.
* It aims to extract valuable features for better analysis and interpretation in the medical domain.
* Developed Masked LoGoNet, a neural network architecture with tailored self-supervised learning for efficient medical image segmentation.

## Bachelor and Master


My Bachelor's thesis focused on __applying reinforcement learning in a multi-object environment__. In this unique setting, each object had the ability to train individually. Additionally, I incorporated federated learning techniques to enable the objects to generalize their models to each other. This research explored the potential of combining these approaches to enhance learning and decision-making in complex environments.

For my Master's thesis, I delved into the realm of __software testing__. Specifically, I proposed an innovative approach to __generating datasets__ using machine learning techniques. This approach aimed to cover the main paths within the software, enabling effective fault detection. By leveraging machine learning, I sought to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of software testing processes, ultimately improving software systems' overall quality and reliability.
