Work experience
======
* __Computer Vision Engineer__ at __Jibb__: San Francisco, USA Des 2020 - Dec 2021
  * I specialize in object detection and the removal of unnecessary elements from images and videos.
  * I have expertise in identifying color discrepancies within visual content and effectively eliminating shadows and reflections.

* __Technical Consultant__ at __BlueBitSoft__: Nijmegen, Netherlands Des 2018 - Dec 2021
  * As a technical consultant at Bluebitsoft, I had the opportunity to contribute my expertise towards designing a robust software architecture for their products. With careful consideration of the organization's unique requirements and objectives, I crafted a high-level architectural framework that addressed their specific needs. This architecture aimed to enhance scalability, reliability, and performance, enabling seamless operations within the software. By collaborating closely with the team, I ensured that the design incorporated efficient data flow, seamless system integration, and robust security measures. The result was an optimized software architecture that laid the foundation for Bluebitsoft's innovative solutions.

* __Senior Data Scientist & Back-End Developer__ at __TAPSI (Online Taxi)__: Tehran, Iran Mar. 2018 - Des 2020
  * Pricing Micro-services: I designed and implemented a pricing micro-service utilizing Python and event messaging through RabbitMQ. This enabled efficient communication and seamless integration within the system. 
  * Fake GPS Detection Algorithm: I developed and implemented an algorithm to detect fake GPS data, creating a micro-service using Python. Event messaging via RabbitMQ facilitated smooth communication between components. 
  * Smart Backend Features: Leveraging unsupervised algorithms, I implemented intelligent features in the backend based on passengers' data. This included origin suggestion, destination suggestion, favorite location suggestion, and ride suggestion functionalities. 
  * ETA Micro-service: I implemented an ETA micro-service that estimated the arrival time using drivers' GPS information. Introducing a novel algorithm based on GPS data, our work was recognized and published in a research paper. 
  * Base Map Generation: Using drivers' GPS information collected during rides, I produced base maps of Tehran and Karaj cities. These maps served as valuable assets for various purposes within the organization. 
  * SMART Map: I implemented a SMART map that predicted locations with higher ride demand rates in cities. This predictive capability helped optimize service allocation and improve overall efficiency.

* __Senior Software Engineer__ at __Haft-Sang Company Group__: Tehran, Iran Apr. 2016 - Mar. 2018
  * As part of my responsibilities, I successfully implemented APIs for streaming various forms of media, including videos and music, enabling seamless access to these resources. This involved designing and developing robust interfaces that facilitated smooth and efficient data transfer.
  * At The Haft-Sang, our technology stack predominantly revolved around ASP.Net and .NetCore for server-side development. These frameworks allowed us to create efficient and scalable software solutions. To ensure effective data storage and management, we utilized SQL Server as our preferred database system.

* __Software Engineer__ at __Shahid Beheshti Cyberspace Faculty__: Tehran, Iran Sep. 2014 - Feb. 2016
  * As part of my role, I successfully developed a crawler and classifier capable of crawling over 1000 websites. This system was designed to extract content and images from these websites for the purpose of classification and categorization. To achieve this, I utilized fuzzy models and neural networks, enabling real-time processing of content streams.
  * In addition, I implemented a Restful API server that facilitated communication between the server-side and client-side of the website. This allowed for seamless data transformation and transfer, enhancing the overall user experience.

* __Software Engineer Internship__ at __Zoraq__: Tehran, Iran Jun. 2013 - Oct. 2013
  * During my professional journey at Zoraq, I gained valuable skills and experience in website development using C# and ASP.NET. I familiarized myself with the process of building robust and dynamic websites, leveraging the capabilities of these technologies.
  * Additionally, I acquired knowledge in creating and managing databases for websites using SQL Server. This involved designing efficient database schemas and utilizing SQL queries to interact with and manipulate data.
  * I also learned how to write Rest APIs, enabling seamless communication between the server-side and client-side of web applications. This allowed for the exchange of data and functionalities in a standardized and efficient manner.
